# JavaScript Assessment

This assessment aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic
and intermediate features. You will not be tested on HTML Canvas,
jQuery, AJAX, or Underscore templates.

You have **80 minutes**. The specs live in the `spec/` directory. Your
code should go in the `src/` directory in the file provided. Problems
are described in that file.

How to run the specs: open up `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.

## Submission

* Rename the directory `first_name_last_name`.
* ZIP it (you can use OS X's built in zip functionality)
* Use `.zip`
* Upload to progress tracker (http://progress.appacademy.io/).
