// Write a recursive function, `baseConverter(n, b)` that takes in a base 10 
// number `n` and converts it to a base `b` number. Assume that `b` will never 
// be greater than 16. Return the new number as a string. If the number is 0, 
// your function should return "0" regardless of the base.
//
// The 'base' of a number refers to the amount of possible digits that can occupy
// one of the places in the number. We are used to base 10 numbers, which use
// the digits 0-9, however in computer science base 2 (binary) and base 16 (hexadecimal)
// numbers are often used. The digits used in base 16 are as follows (from 
// smallest to largest):
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f]
//
// Examples: 
// baseConverter(0, 2) => "0"
// baseConverter(5, 2) => "101"
// baseConverter(25, 16) => 19
// baseConverter(31, 16) => "1f"
