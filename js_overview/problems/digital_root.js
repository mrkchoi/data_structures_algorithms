// Write a function, `digitalRoot(num)`. It should sum the digits of a positive
// integer. If the result is greater than 10, sum the digits of the resulting number.
// Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the result, called the
// "digital root". **Do not use string conversion within your method.**
// For further explanation on the digital root concept, refer here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root
//
// You may wish to use a helper function, `digitalRootStep(num)` which performs
// one step of the process.
