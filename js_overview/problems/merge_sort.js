// Write an `Array.prototype.mergeSort` method that merge sorts an array. It
// should take an optional callback that compares two elements, returning -1 if 
// the first element should appear before the second, 0 if they are equal, and 1 
// if the first element should appear after the second. Define and use a helper 
// method, `merge(left, right, comparator)`, to merge the halves. Make sure that 
// `merge` is defined on the window. Do NOT call the built-in 
// `Array.prototype.sort` method in your implementation.
//
// Here's a summary of the merge sort algorithm:
//
// Split the array into left and right halves, then merge sort them recursively
// until a base case is reached. Use a helper method, merge, to combine the
// halves in sorted order, and return the merged array.
